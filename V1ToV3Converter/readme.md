HnD v1 to v3 converter
==============

In case you run a v1 or v2 HnD board, you need to convert it to v3. This tool can convert a database with v1 or v2 data to v3. 
Be sure to first convert the table layout to v3 using the migration script in the SQL Scripts folder in the main HnD repo. 

After this tool has successfully converted everything, you can reparse all messages from the HnD admin menu to make them have their new markdown converted into Html.
